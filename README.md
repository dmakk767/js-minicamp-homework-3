# Homework #3

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Objects -
	Objects are just like objects in the real world. Take a table for example. In the real world we would describe the table by listing of its characteristics. We 
	might say it has four legs, a large surface on top, and is made of wood. in a similar way we could make an object in our code that holds all this information in
	what we call a key and value relationship. The keys to our table would be number of legs, size of top surface, and type of material it is made of. Then for key of
	those keys we could store our values; 4 legs, large, wood. By accessing this object we could gain a better idea of what our table actually looks and feels like. 
	
	* Properties - 
	Properties are the parts of the object that hold information used to describe the object. In our previous example about the object named table the properties
	might look something like this: legs, size, material. Each of these properties would contain a value that helps describe the object. The legs property
	would contain the number of legs. The size property would tell us how large the surface area is. And the material would hold what the table is made out of. 

	* Methods -
	Methods are a set of instructions that can be included in an object. In our case we have an object describing a table. We could make a method that list off all 
	the objects key and value pairings at once. This would save us the trouble of accessing each one individually. Another common example: Consider an object called person
	that has the key and value pairings of firstName:John and lastName:Doe. We could then write a method inside the object to return the full name of John Doe.  

	* for in loop - 
	Just like we use a for loop to look at each item stored in a list (array), we use for-in-loops to look at each property stored in an object. We could say something
	like for each property in the object do this. This would look at each property and do the requested task. 
	
	* dot notation vs bracket notation - 
	While they essentailly do the same job there are a few differences between the two. In order to use a variable name or a call that contains a special character
	we need to use bracket notation. Let's say we want to use the property inside an object, but the property name itself contains a ".", it would confuse the program
	trying to use dot notation, to get around this we can use the brackets. The dot notation is basically used we we are trying to call a predefined key names.


2. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.
		
	* git status
	* git add --all
	* git status
	* git commit -m "your commit message"
	* git push origin master

3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.  Run tests using `npm test`.

4. Make the tests pass!
